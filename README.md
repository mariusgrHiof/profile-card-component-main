### What I learned

I've learned how to utilize flexbox to layout my page and make it responsive on tablet and mobile devices.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I'm going to enhance my HTML and CSS skills by continue creating more sites and add javaScript to make the sites interactive.

### Useful resources
